# Webcam Testing Website

This is a simple website that allows users to test their webcam to ensure that it's working properly. The website is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/webcam-testing-website.git


Next, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

cd ui
npm install

To start the development server, run the following command:

./start_ui

The website should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To use the webcam testing tool, simply click the "Test Webcam" button on the home page. You'll be prompted to allow the website to access your webcam. Once you've granted permission, you should see a live video stream from your webcam.

## Customization

If you'd like to customize the website's styling, you can modify the CSS files in the `styles` directory. The website is built using Tailwind CSS, so you can use all of Tailwind's utility classes to style your components.
